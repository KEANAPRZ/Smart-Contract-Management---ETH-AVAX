# Smart-Contract-Management---ETH-AVAX
Second Module Assement For MetaCrafters ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course

# Description
This code is a Solidity contract named Assessment that manages a balance and allows the owner to deposit and withdraw Ether. The contract has a constructor that sets the initial balance and the owner's address. The contract has two events, Deposit and Withdraw, that are emitted when a deposit or withdrawal is made. The contract has two functions, getBalance and deposit, that allow the owner to retrieve the current balance and deposit Ether, respectively. The contract also has a withdraw function that allows the owner to withdraw Ether, with a custom error InsufficientBalance that is thrown if the balance is less than the requested withdrawal amount. The contract uses require statements to ensure that the sender is the owner and that the balance is sufficient for the requested withdrawal. The contract also uses assert statements to ensure that the balance is updated correctly. The app also include a Calculate factorial which calculate the factorial of the given amount and a functon of Check Palindrome which check and calculate the palindrome.

# Technology Used
This project utilizes the following technologies:

* Solidity: Solidity is a programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. It is used to write the Bank smart contract in this project. Learn more about Solidity.

* Ethers.js: Ethers.js is a JavaScript library that provides a concise and consistent API for interacting with Ethereum and Ethereum-like networks. It is used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and execute transactions in this project. Explore Ethers.js.

* MetaMask: MetaMask is a popular browser extension wallet that allows users to manage Ethereum accounts and interact with decentralized applications. It is used to connect to the Ethereum network and perform transactions in this project. Get MetaMask.

* Hardhat: Hardhat is a development environment and testing framework for Ethereum smart contracts. It provides tools for compiling, deploying, and testing contracts. Hardhat is used to compile and deploy the Bank smart contract in this project. Discover Hardhat.

# Installation
## Follow these steps to get the project up and running 
1. Download or clone the project.
2. Install the dependencies by running npm install.
3. Start the local blockchain using Hardhat by running npx hardhat node.
4. Open new terminal and deploy the Bank contract npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js.
5. Start the development server by running npm run dev.
## Configure MetaMask to use the Hardhat node 
1. Open the MetaMask extension in your browser.
2. Click on the account icon in the top right corner and select "Settings".
3. In the "Networks" tab, click on "Add Network".
4. Fill in the following details:
* Network Name: hardhat-test-network
* RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545/
* Chain ID: 31337
* Currency Symbol: GO or ETH
5. Click on "Save" to add the Hardhat network to MetaMask.

## Add accounts using private keys by Hardhat for testing 
1. In the MetaMask extension, click on the account icon in the top right corner.
2. Select "Import Account" or "Import Account using Private Key" (depending on your version of MetaMask).
3. In the "Private Key" field, enter one of the private keys provided by Hardhat.
4. To access the list of private keys, open the terminal where you started the Hardhat local network.
5. The private keys are displayed as part of the accounts generated by Hardhat.
6. Click on "Import" to import the account into MetaMask.
7. Repeat the above steps to add more accounts for testing purposes.
   
# Components 
* It defines several state variables, including ethWallet, account, atm, balance, amountInput, factorialResult, and palindromeResult.
* The contractAddress and atmABI variables are defined to hold the address and ABI of the smart contract.
* The getWallet function checks if the user has MetaMask installed and sets the ethWallet state variable accordingly.
* The handleAccount function sets the account state variable based on the user's MetaMask account.
* The connectAccount function prompts the user to connect their MetaMask wallet and sets the account state variable accordingly. It also calls the getATMContract function to get a reference to the smart contract.
* The getATMContract function creates a new instance of the smart contract using the ethers library and sets the atm state variable.
* The getBalance function retrieves the user's balance from the smart contract and sets the balance state variable.
* The deposit and withdraw functions allow the user to deposit and withdraw Ether from the smart contract, respectively.
* The calculateFactorial and checkPalindrome functions perform calculations on the amountInput state variable and set the factorialResult and palindromeResult state variables accordingly.
* The displayMyInfo function displays the user's information in an alert box.
* The initUser function checks if the user has MetaMask installed and if they are connected to their account. If not, it prompts them to connect. It also displays the user's account and balance, as well as buttons for depositing and withdrawing Ether and performing calculations.
* The useEffect hook is used to call the getWallet function when the component mounts.
* The component returns a JSX element that displays the user interface for interacting with the smart contract ATM.
